# gar-library-2202-VERSION
Yeah uhh this isn't actually any library or anything this is part of an arg that i made and i had to put this stuff somewhere <-(ignore this arg people)
Somewhere, only three codes can access. Mountains in Antarctica where the lab is, ever lost under the ice. Beneath the ice grew a power. Opened up was a crack in the earth, darkness flowed from it. Yesterday, heard from the lab... extravagent bursts startling the penguins. 
Lost now, penguins turn against discover it, monsterous shapes take form from them as they enter the fountain. Extravagent because... I am lazy. Major penguin the second found a strange fish. Bell rings from the tower as the fish, existing as Rethinkinggarhost. I'm that strange fish.
Nothing will ever stop me from being the bestest. Gone are the days of Syol and Aer.
